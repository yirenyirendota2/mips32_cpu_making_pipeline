CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net stable_reset is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): stable_reset_reg/Q
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_50M_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_50M_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
